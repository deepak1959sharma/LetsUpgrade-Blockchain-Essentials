Q1. What is your understanding of Blockchain?

Ans. Has my understanding The Blockchain technology that holds transactional records by ensuring security, transparency, and decentralization. Each block contains a cryptographic data of previous data. It is also a distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.

Q2. What is the core problem Blockchain trying to solve?
core problems:

1. Security
2. Decentralization.
3. Authentication.

Some other problems can be solved:

1. Real Estate
2. Crowdfunding
3. Intellectual Property
4. Voting System
5. Currency and Transaction Support

Q3. What are the few features which Blockchain will give u?

1. Verifiable
2. Unchangeable
3. Tamper proof
4. Immutable
5. Decentralized System
6. Minting

Q4. What all things does a Block Contain?

1. Block magic number.
2. Records.
3. Previous block signature.
5. Mining Key.

Q5. How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained?

The Blockchain can be verifiability by the data or the key which are stored in the distributed systems.

Formula:-

Current Block Signature = Previous Block Signature + Data in the Block
ex: BlockData = Fingerprint1
New Data1 + previous fingerprint 1 = Fingerprint 2
New Data2 + previous fingerprint 2 = Fingerprint 3 and
so on...
